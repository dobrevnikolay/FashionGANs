# Fashion GANs
!! The project is still under development !!
Python implementation of [Be Your Own Prada:Fashion Synthesis](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/FashionGAN/). Which uses GANs to change the clothing in a picture of a certain model preserving its structure and other physical features.
## How to use
1. Create a data folder under the root directory place there idx.mat, language_original.mat and G2.h5 files downloaded from [here](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html)
2. Run any of the train files to pickle the data then use the jupyter notebook, that could be found under /jupyter

## Dependencies
1. Numpy
```sh
$ pip3 install numpy
```
2. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
3. [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
4. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/users/installing.html)

## Architecture
To be added soon
